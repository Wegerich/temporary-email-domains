This is a list of disposable/temporary email domains out there. There are many websites (eg. http://10minutemail.net/, http://guerrillamail.com/ etc) which provides disposable emails. Some of them updates their email domains in regular intervals. So this list will be updated as well.

Of course i cannot keep this list updated alone, so any user contribution is welcome.
